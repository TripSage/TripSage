## Hello! Welcome to TripSage! </br>
### Why TripSage? </br>
Travelling to a new country can be stressful. Couple that with COVID, almost impossible. But the mental health benefits of travelling to new and exciting places doesn’t have to be so risky and expensive. </br>
TripSage is a website that plans trips for users inside their home country. Simply, pick a destination state and cities, and you’ll be directed to your ideal trip. We have plans to include tags for: COVID -19 hotspots, whether the location is indoors, and the general population at that location to make sure users can practice safe travelling.</br>
</br>
A new way of life doesn’t have to mean you can’t travel.</br>
