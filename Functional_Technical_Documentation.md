## 1.4 Why TripSage

Travelling to a new country can be stressful. Couple that with COVID,
almost impossible. But the mental health benefits of travelling to new
and exciting places doesn't have to be so risky and expensive.

TripSage is a website that plans trips for users inside their home
country. Simply, pick a destination state and cities, and you'll be
directed to your ideal trip. We have plans to include tags for: COVID
-19 hotspots, whether the location is indoors, and the general
population at that location to make sure users can practice safe
travelling.

A new way of life doesn't have to mean you can't travel.

Explore the new way of travelling with TripSage.

# 2.0 Functional Specifications:

## 2.1 Overview

TripSage is the ultimate itinerary planner to help users in their travel
plans. This application will allow a user to plan their trip according
to their vacation preferences. Whether you are travelling with your
kids, want an adventurous trip with your friends group or want a weekend
to relax and unwind, TripSage will create the perfect itinerary for you.
It will guide the user with the best time to visit their preferred
places, the latest Covid -- 19 updates and the best route to travel, all
while adhering to the user's budget.

The scope of TripSage can be defined using the following functionalities
in a broad sense

- Users can login to the website
- Flow 1:
  - Accept the inputs \[Appendix-A\] from the user.
  - Display/suggest places to visit with the tags
  1. Best time tovisit
  2. Covid warnings
  3. Type of the place (Adventurous, Sightseeing, good for food, sport, etc)
- Users can pick the places to visit from these suggestions and press next.
- TripSage will generate itineraries using the places users want to visit.
- Tripsage will suggest the cheapest route to the user
- Flow 2:
  - Accept the inputs \[Appendix-A\] from the user.
  - From the type of trip the user wants, TripSage generates an itinerary using the places to visit from the destination cities the user is planning to visit.
  - Tripsage will suggest the cheapest route to the user

## 2.2 Why Django?

**Why Django?** </br>
</br>
The purpose behind choosing Django was two-fold. We wanted to challenge ourselves with this project, but set realistic expectations. So, instead of learning a new language for web development, we decided to use a Python framework, a language our entire team (and many others) are comfortable with. </br>
</br>
Also, Django follows MVT(model-view-template) architecture which can be used independently making it reliable, flexible and simple. Moreover, it has its own server and the learning curve is pretty minimum. Compared to Flask, Django is used for applications that serve more than just one requirement. We envision and designed TripSage to include many features, making Django the better choice.
</br>

# 3.0 Technical Specifications:

## 3.1 Software

The TripSage application is built with Django, an open source web application framework, written in Python. The location data displayed in the itinerary is fetched using Google Geolocation API. Alternatively, in a different version, data will be stored in a SQLite3, also open source. The user interface is developed in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Ajax. The backend is coded in Python. The application is compatible with all web browsers. The application code uses Git version control, and all commits will be archived in a designated repository.

## 3.2 Django Architecture

![](https://github.com/TripSage/TripSage/blob/master/Assets/DjangoArch.png)

TripSage is developed with Django, a high-level Python web application framework that enables the rapid development of web applications. It follows the MTV (Model Template View) architecture:

1.  User requests for Django based website

2.  URL calls corresponding function in **views.py** (mapping found in urls.py)

    a. view can take a request and return a response

    b. view interacts with Model and Template

3.  Template is combination of static HTML and Django Syntax (Python)

4.  Model is a class representing table/collection in models.py

## 3.3 Models

Following is the list of Models in TripSage and a brief description of
each: </br>
City: To store cities </br>
Trip: To store the trips generated from the itinerary planner </br>
Places: Locations/spots within cities that will be displayed as part of the itinerary </br>
Destinations: The cities that can be destinations </br>
Contains: To store the mapping between Places and Cities </br>
Tags: Different tags which will be used to tag Places </br>
Tagged_as: To store the mapping between Places and Tags </br>

# 4.0 Future improvements

## 4.1 What has been Implemented?

The TripSage application currently supports the following functionalities:</br>
</br>
Allow user to create a Trip using Flow\#2 where, the user only inputs the destination city/cities to visit and Type/types of trip along with the estimated Trip time.</br>
</br>
The website uses Google Maps api to fetch the appropriate places for the given destination along with their ratings and displays the list of places.</br>

## 4.2 What needs to be done?

The following functionalities have not been implemented yet:</br>
</br>
1.User Login: Update models.py \[Left to acquaint Team 2 about the database structure\] to include User \[EmailId, Password\] and Trips_Planned \[EmailId, TripId\]. Implement authentication page and retrieve Trips saved by User.</br>
</br> 2. Sharing Trips: Allow users to share trips they created with other users.</br>
</br> 3. Implementation of an algorithm to create an itinerary from the places retrieved using the api. The algorithm will be a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, constrained by best time to visit a place and the location of a place. However, details of exact implementation are left for the next team. </br>
</br> 4. Implementation of functionality using Google Maps \[or any other api (decision left for next team)\] to determine the cheapest Travel route based on the destinations and number of people.</br>
</br> 5. Implementation of Trip Creation using Flow\#1, where a user already has a trip planned to the exact dot, including the places, they want to visit and only need our assistance to schedule and get the cheapest travel route.</br>

## 4.3 Ambitious Suggestions:

</br>
While showing the suggestions itself, users can remove suggested places, modifying the itinerary dynamically. </br>
</br>
Dynamic computation of Popularity and covid tags based on the no of trips generated for the particular place on a given date. </br>

# 5.0 Appendix and Resources

## 5.2 Inspirations

1.  Sygic Travel https://travel.sygic.com/en
    </br>
    Tell Sygic where you\'re going and for how many days. Based on that, the app will create a custom itinerary of the top attractions in that place, along with where you should go on which day.

2.  Inspirock https://www.inspirock.com
    </br>
    A very close Itinerary planner with suggestion algorithm inbuilt into the website, with the only feature missing is the ability to suggest a cheapest route. </br>
    </br>

3.  Google Map API

The Places API lets you search for place information using a variety of categories, including establishments, prominent points of interest, and geographic locations. You can search for places either by proximity or a text string. A Place Search returns a list of places along with summary information about each place; additional information is available via a Place Details query.</br>
</br>
The Find Place request is an HTTP URL of the following form: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/output?parameters where output may be either of the following values: json (recommended) indicates output in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) xml indicates output as XML We need to generate a key (from google cloud services) which can authenticate the request we send to Google Maps place API. Since, we connect/authorize the key using our gmail account, we use one of the gmail accounts from our group. For the extension, we can provide our key/can help generate a key for you.
